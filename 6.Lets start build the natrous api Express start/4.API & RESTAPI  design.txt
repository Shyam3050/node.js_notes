API : application programming interface.
a pieace of software that can be used by another piece of software in order to
allow application to talk each other.

The Rest Architecture.

1. separate API  into logical resources.
 resource: Object or representation of something. which has data associated to it.
 https://www.xyz.com/tours
 
2. structured url
https://www.xyz.com/tours

3. use HTTP methods.

POST : /tours: create
GET : /tours : read
PUT/PATCH :/tours/7 : update 
DELETE : /tours/3 : delete

End points are same for all GET, POST, PUT, DELETE but incase of GET we send back
data to client, but POST we expect data from client.

4. sned data as Json.
json is a light weight format of data which is used to sharing over internet.

5. Be stateless

All state is handled on the client this means that each request must contains all the
information necessary to process a certain request. The server should not have
to remember previous request.

BAD : GET /tours/nextpage

// server will need to remember the currentpage
server         nextpage = currentPage + 1
             send(nextpage)

Good: GET /tours/page/8

// server will directly send page 8.
server         send(8)
